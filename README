This script converts downloaded HGMD data into a custom annotation
file that can be imported into VariantStudio.

By default, it will process all *.txt files in the current working
directory.

To prepare this script to be run in a windows enviornment without the
need for running a Perl script:

0) Do a git commit and tag the version you want to release.

1) run make_dist.sh -- this will create a copy of documentation with
   the verion number into dist/, and also a copy of the perl script
   with the verion number in exe/ and dist/.

2) Convert the Perl script to a windows executable. This requires that
   you have Strawberry Perl and the pp module installed on a Windows
   box/VM. See below on how to do that.
   a) Open a windows command prompt.
   b) Change to the directory containing the exe subdir.
   c) Type the following command:
      build_exe.bat

3) Then run dist.sh in exe. This will zip the Windows binary and move
   it to dist/. And then clean up the exe/ subdir.

You should now have a version of the executable and documentation
tagged with the current version of the script being used.

----------
Installing Strawberry Perl and PP:
  A) Find a windows box (or VM)

  B) Install Strawberry Perl http://strawberryperl.com/

  C) Install the pp Perl module (only needs to be done once):
      i) Windows Menu -> Strawberry Perl -> Tools -> CPAN Client
     ii) Run the following command from that window: "install pp"
